# Rules added by naturalizer
In SOULPACK rule syntax, you can express the statement "If a person oversees a project, they are responsible for it" as follows:

```
RULE: oversee_project_implies_responsibility
IF 
    Person(P) AND 
    Oversees(P, Project)
THEN 
    Responsible(P, Project)
```

In this rule:
- `Person(P)` denotes that P is a person.
- `Oversees(P, Project)` indicates that P oversees a specific project.
- `Responsible(P, Project)` shows that P is responsible for that project. 

This syntax captures the conditional relationship between overseeing a project and being responsible for it.
